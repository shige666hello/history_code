**Excalibur** is a web interface to extract tabular data from PDFs, written in **Python 3**! It powered by `Camelot <https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/>`_.

.. note:: Excalibur only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents. (As Tabula `explains`_, "If you can click and drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based".)

Using Excalibur
---------------

**Note:** You need to `install ghostscript <https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install-deps.html>`_ before moving forward.

After :ref:`installing Excalibur with pip <install>` (), you can initialize the metadata database using::

    $ excalibur initdb

And then start the webserver using::

    $ excalibur webserver

That's it! Now you can go to http://localhost:8080 and start extracting tabular data from your PDFs.

1. **Upload** a PDF and enter the page numbers you want to extract tables from.

2. Go to each page and select the table by drawing a box around it. (You can choose to skip this step since Excalibur can automatically detect tables on its own. Click on "**Autodetect tables**" to see what Excalibur sees.)

3. Choose a flavor (Lattice or Stream) from "**Advanced**".

    a. **Lattice**: For tables formed with lines.

    b. **Stream**: For tables formed with whitespaces.

4. Click on "**View and download data**" to see the extracted tables.

5. Select your favorite format (CSV/Excel/JSON/HTML) and click on "**Download**"!

.. note:: You can also download executables for Windows and Linux from the `releases page`_ and run them directly!

Why Excalibur?
--------------

- Extracting tables from PDFs is hard. A simple copy-and-paste from a PDF into an Excel doesn't preserve table structure. **Excalibur makes PDF table extraction very easy**, by automatically detecting tables in PDFs and letting you save them into CSVs and Excels.
- Excalibur uses `Camelot <https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/>`_ under the hood, which gives you additional settings to tweak table extraction and get the best results. You can see how it performs better than other open-source tools and libraries `in this comparison`_.
- You can save table extraction :ref:`settings <faq>` (like table areas) for a PDF once, and apply them on new PDFs to extract tables with similar structures.
- You get complete control over your data. All file storage and processing happens on your own local or remote machine.
- Excalibur can be configured with MySQL and Celery for parallel and distributed workloads. By default, sqlite and multiprocessing are used for sequential workloads.
